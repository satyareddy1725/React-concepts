# functional based components and class based components
----> end of the day function based component is a javascript class
# class UseClass extends React.Component {}
----> the extends will make react to know this is class based components 

----inside the cls.fun we have render method that gives the piece of jsx

# React.Component is given by react and in the class user can inheritance some methods in to the component 

------------------------------------------------------------------
# props how to pass
----> in the class based componets the props will pass through constructor and we use super(props) and we accesing the props by wriitng this.props.name

# u can accesing your props where u want in the class cfunctions 
------------------------------------------------------------
# life cycle of the react class based components
 1---> classLoads  or class instantiated then 
 --> constructor is initialized  or called then 
 ---> render is called
 ----> ComponentDidMount called
